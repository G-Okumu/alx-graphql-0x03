#  Mastering Error Handling

- This project implements an Error Boundary component in a Next.js application to gracefully handle JavaScript errors that occur during rendering. The solution includes creating an ErrorBoundary class component, integrating it with the application, testing it with an error-prone component, and adding error monitoring with Sentry.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how React Error Boundaries work
- Implement a class component in TypeScript
- Handle runtime errors gracefully in a Next.js application
- Integrate third-party error monitoring services
- Test error handling components effectively
## Key Concepts

- `Error Boundaries:`: Special React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree
- `Component Lifecycle Methods`: Using getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch to handle errors
- `Error Monitoring`: Integrating services like Sentry for production error tracking
- `Fall Back UI`: Providing user-friendly error messages when components fail
- `Error Recovery`: Implementing “Try again” functionality for user
